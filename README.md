# doom-engine

OpenGL graphics engine in Rust

## Progress

Got some structs and methods for Buffer and Array Objects, Textures, etc.

Got matrices and vectors for calculations

Decided on using egui since I could find some dependencies to make it work with glfw and gl

Currently doing a mesh struct to import object files

## Demos

Fragment coloring and quads
